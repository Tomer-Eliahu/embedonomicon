# A note on compiler support

This book makes use of a built-in *compiler* target, the `thumbv7m-none-eabi`, for which the Rust
team distributes a `rust-std` component, which is a pre-compiled collection of crates like [`core`]
and [`std`].

[`core`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html
[`std`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html

If you want to attempt replicating the contents of this book for a different target architecture,
you need to take into account the different levels of support that Rust provides for (compilation)
targets.

## LLVM support

As of Rust 1.28, the official Rust compiler, `rustc`, uses LLVM for (machine) code generation. The
minimal level of support Rust provides for an architecture is having its LLVM backend enabled in
`rustc`. You can see all the architectures that `rustc` supports, through LLVM, by running the
following command:

``` console
$ # you need to have `cargo-binutils` installed to run this command
$ cargo objdump -- --version
LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
  LLVM version 7.0.0svn
  Optimized build.
  Default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
  Host CPU: skylake

  Registered Targets:
    aarch64    - AArch64 (little endian)
    aarch64_be - AArch64 (big endian)
    arm        - ARM
    arm64      - ARM64 (little endian)

    x86-64     - 64-bit X86: EM64T and AMD64
```

If LLVM supports the architecture you are interested in, but `rustc` is built with the backend
disabled (which is the case of AVR as of Rust 1.28), then you will need to modify the Rust source
enabling it. The first two commits of PR [rust-lang/rust#52787] give you an idea of the required
changes.

[rust-lang/rust#52787]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52787

On the other hand, if LLVM doesn't support the architecture, but a fork of LLVM does, you will have
to replace the original version of LLVM with the fork before building `rustc`. The Rust build system
allows this and in principle it should just require changing the `llvm` submodule to point to the
fork.

If your target architecture is only supported by some vendor-provided GCC, you have the option of
using [`mrustc`], an unofficial Rust compiler, to translate your Rust program into C code and then
compile that using GCC.

## Built-in target

A compilation target is more than just its architecture. Each target has a [specification]
associated to it that describes, among other things, its architecture, its operating system and the
default linker.

[specification]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0131-target-specification.md

The Rust compiler knows about several targets. These are *built into* the compiler and can be listed
by running the following command:

``` console

You can print the specification of one of these targets using the following command:

``` console
$ rustc +nightly -Z unstable-options --print target-spec-json --target thumbv7m-none-eabi
{
  "abi-blacklist": [
    "stdcall",
    "fastcall",
    "vectorcall",
    "thiscall",
    "win64",
    "sysv64"
  ],
  "arch": "arm",
  "data-layout": "e-m:e-p:32:32-i64:64-v128:64:128-a:0:32-n32-S64",
  "emit-debug-gdb-scripts": false,
  "env": "",
  "executables": true,
  "is-builtin": true,
  "linker": "arm-none-eabi-gcc",
  "linker-flavor": "gcc",
  "llvm-target": "thumbv7m-none-eabi",
  "max-atomic-width": 32,
  "os": "none",
  "panic-strategy": "abort",
  "relocation-model": "static",
  "target-c-int-width": "32",
  "target-endian": "little",
  "target-pointer-width": "32",
  "vendor": ""
}
```

If none of these built-in targets seems appropriate for your target system, you'll have to create a
custom target by writing your own target specification file in JSON format which is described in the
[next section][custom-target].

[custom-target]: ./custom-target.md

## `rust-std` component

For some of the built-in target the Rust team distributes `rust-std` components via `rustup`. This
component is a collection of pre-compiled crates like `core` and `std`, and it's required for cross
compilation.

You can find the list of targets that have a `rust-std` component available via `rustup` by running
the following command:

``` console

If there's no `rust-std` component for your target, or you are using a custom target, then you'll
have to use a nightly toolchain to build the standard library. See the next page about [building for
custom targets][use-target-file].
